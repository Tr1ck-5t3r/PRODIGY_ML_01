# Prodigy Infotech Task 1:

## Task Description:

Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Dataset:

The dataset is provided in the file `data.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- date
- price
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- sqft_living
- sqft_lot
- floors
- waterfront
- view
- condition
- sqft_above
- sqft_basement
- yr_built
- yr_renovated
- street
- city
- statezip
- country

## Deliverables:

- A Jupyter notebook containing the code for the linear regression model.
- A CSV file containing the predicted prices of the houses in the dataset.

## Results and Discussion:

The linear regression model was implemented successfully in predicting the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

The model was trained on the given dataset and was able to predict the prices of houses with a good accuracy based on the given features.

Linear, Ridge, ElasticNet regression model was implemented and the best model was selected based on the R2 score.

Linear regression model was selected as the best model.

## Conclusion:

The linear regression model was able to predict the prices of houses with a good accuracy based on the given features.
